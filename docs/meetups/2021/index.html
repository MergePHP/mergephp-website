			What is a JSON Web Token (JWT) and why do you care? JWTs are a stateless, standardized way to represent user data. This talk will discuss why JWTs matter and the nuts and bolts of JWTs. We&#039;ll also discuss how you might use a JWT in your web application and how to avoid certain common mistakes.

		<p>
			PHP loves its arrays. Arrays are the uber-data structure. They‚Äôre a list, a map, a stack, a queue, everything in one! Which is the problem.

Modern PHP grossly over-uses arrays. In most cases there are better options today, and when you find yourself reaching for ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll just make this an associative array‚Äù, stop. An extra 60 seconds of thought and code will often give you a more readable, faster, more memory-efficient, more flexible alternative. Classes, iterables, and collections can and shou

			In this talk, I&#039;ll be documenting the trials and tribulations I&#039;ve experienced when working with Unicode; from encoding, to normalization, and the not-so-obvious differences between alphabets. I&#039;ll take you on the usual Product/Engineering journey where requirements can change, bugs are discovered where you least expect them, and your knowledge of Unicode needs to be as flexible as your Product Manager&#039;s priorities. You think &#039;Gem√ºse&#039; === &#039;Gem√ºse&#039;? You might be wrong!

With NGINX Unit we will have Full control over the Network as well as the Application Stack. Join us to learn more about how I moved my workload to NGINX Unit and why I would do it anytime again!

		<p>
			PHPStan is an excellent open-source static analysis tool. It&#039;s easy to add to your build and catches lots of bugs without writing a line of test code. This makes it especially useful for  maintaining stability in older codebases which don&#039;t always have extensive test suites. I&#039;ll show  you how to configure and run it, as well as some examples of subtle mistakes it will catch.

			Interested in learning more about Agile? Me too! I am here to tell you that Agile can be applied to your life outside of software. Don&#039;t worry, there is a method to these processes or routines we are doing on a regular basis. Let&#039;s learn about how we can get better at these systems and turn them into more productive practices. Irene is here to teach you all things Agile.

			In a landmark decision that marked the end of a ten year saga, the Supreme Court ruled that APIs are not copyrightable. In this talk, we&#039;ll take a look at the claims from copyright to patent infringement, review the history of decisions, and look into the key statements behind the Supreme Court ruling. We&#039;ll discuss what this likely means for the future of code interfaces and what it means for interoperability. Note - this is not legal advice.

			With a large, globally distributed engineering department of over 2,000 engineers, service discoverability and access to API documentation are important problems at Wayfair. Integrations between systems require close coordination and overhead, making these kinds of projects expensive and brittle. To address this problem, we sought to surface OpenAPI documentation in our Backstage Service Catalog.

We will discuss how over 175 API specifications are shared amongst teams at Wayfair. Our solution l

			How we develop software has come a long way since I started working with PHP 4.0. Today with tools like Docker, we can put each project in a container and isolate it from all other projects. The promise of Docker though has been difficult to deliver on. Crafting the proper config files and making sure all the pieces work together and talk together can be a daunting task, especially for a developer that just wants to get something done.

Enter Lando. Lando is an abstraction layer on top of Docker

			It is straightforward to open source a piece of code and call it a library. It is effortless to maintain it when you are the only user, but what happens when you reach the first hundred or thousand downloads.

Semantic versioning, changelog, stable release, backward compatibility, continuous integration, and code coverage would probably be some of the buzzwords that would pop up into your head.

Let&#039;s go through the process of being a responsible open-source developer and maintainer.

			It&#039;s the year 2021, an exciting time for the tech industry. Globally, software organisations and internet companies are delivering more and more software, at a rate and scale that we&#039;ve never faced before.

This unprecedented demand has created new challenges for us all, which have been hurting our organizations when creating continuous delivery solutions.

The great thing about these new challenges is that they&#039;ve sparked new and amazing innovations in the CI/CD industry.

			This month, we&#039;ll look at what&#039;s new, changed, and deprecated in the brand-new PHP 8.1. From larger changes like enums, fibers, readonly properties, and first-class callables, to smaller quality of life improvements like string-unpacked array keys and the array_is_list function, Laravel Austin&#039;s (and co-organizer of Longhorn PHP) Hunter Skrasek will guide you through what makes PHP 8.1 worth the upgrade effort.
