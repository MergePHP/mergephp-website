		<p>It's the year 2021, an exciting time for the tech industry. Globally, software organisations and internet companies are delivering more and more software, at a rate and scale that we've never faced before.</p>
<p>This unprecedented demand has created new challenges for us all, which have been hurting our organizations when creating continuous delivery solutions.</p>
<p>The great thing about these new challenges is that they've sparked new and amazing innovations in the CI/CD industry.</p>
<p>In Paul's talk he will be showing you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new innovations the CI/CD, Cloud Native and Open Source communities have been developing.</li>
<li>Where these innovations are taking the world of continuous delivery.</li>
<li>What to expect, from the CD community, later this year, and into the future</li>
</ul>
