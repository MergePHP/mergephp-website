		<p>At the beginning of 2020, Zend spun off Zend Framework to the Linux Foundation under the name &quot;The Laminas Project&quot;. When it did so, it also spun off its two subprojects, Apigility and Expressive, as Laminas API Tools and Mezzio, respectively.</p>
<p>What has the project been up to since then? And what are some of the things you can expect in the future? Who's running the project now?</p>
<p>Come join Matthew Weier O'Phinney as he tells the tale of two frameworks.</p>
