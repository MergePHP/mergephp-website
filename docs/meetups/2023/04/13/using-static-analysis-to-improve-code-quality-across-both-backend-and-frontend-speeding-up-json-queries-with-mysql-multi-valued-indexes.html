		<p>This month we will have two talks!</p>
<p>First, from Daniel Abernathy:
This talk will cover Multi-Valued Indexes, a feature released in MySQL 8 which lets you index an array of values per row - perfect for improving queries that rely on certain JSON functions.</p>
<p>And from Hunter Skrasek:</p>
<p>Numerous technologies exist for creating web applications, with PHP and JavaScript being the most prevalent. Their dynamic typing and runtime execution capabilities allow for a seamless transition from prototype to finished product. However, as apps grow in complexity and significance in our everyday lives, the absence of type safety and compilation checks might be felt. In this presentation, we will explore the concept of static analysis and its potential to enhance your team's software development process.</p>
