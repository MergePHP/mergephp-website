		<p>Years ago, Ed Finkler opened up and told the community about his struggles with depression and anxiety. Fast forward today, and he has successful led a group of passionate people in an organization called Open Sourcing Mental Illness.\n\nThis talk will focus on our efforts as an organization, where we have been, where we are going and also dive into some numbers and stories along the way. While this is a heavier talk, I tend to inject humor where I can to keep it light while still delivering an impactful message.</p>
