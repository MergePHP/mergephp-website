			In this talk, I&#039;ll crack open my toolbox and share some of the tools I use in daily development and why I think they improve the DX of projects I work on. We&#039;ll look at some familiar tools, such as PHPUnit and PHP_CodeSniffer, along with new tools like PHPStan and Psalm. I&#039;ll show how to configure these tools for better workflows through Composer scripts and plugins. We&#039;ll also see how to standardize your team&#039;s workflow with CaptainHook. By the end, I hope you&#039;ll leave with some good ideas for

			When building Covie, I got to pick our tech stack, including where and how to run it. The choice was containerized on ECS with AWS, starting on Fargate.and so far, so good. We&#039;ll walk through how to set this stack up, with some tips and tricks along the way.

			You may have heard the call for contributions to PHP, and you want to help. However, you don&#039;t know C, and don&#039;t want to become a C developer. Worry not, fellow PHP dev! There are other areas of PHP internals that need your help! This talk will pull back the veil on some of the lesser known areas of PHP docs and tooling that need sprucing up and improving.

			Writing modern JavaScript applications can sometimes be such a pain. We know that JavaScript can be great for a user&#039;s experience and add whole new layers of exciting interactivity, but sometimes just the thought of having to leave our server-side PHP applications in the dust to build a single-page app can have us running for the hills. Surely, there must be a better way. And there is. Enter the Modern Monolith.

			In this talk, we will be going over an open source project called PHPobos which shows how to use AWS, GitHub, Docker, and Terraform to build a seamless test, build, &amp; deployment pipeline for your PHP App. Both GitHub Actions and Terraform are very powerful tools but become extraordinarily powerful when combined to build CI/CD pipelines. We will go over how the GitHub Actions test &amp; package your app in a Docker container, how it pushes that image up to AWS, and how the Elastic Container service w

			In this talk we&#039;ll look at how you can take advantage of some of the serverless platforms without taking on the complexity of managing a separate deploy process, development repository, or having to worry about securing your microservice&#039;s API. We&#039;ll see how to package, deploy, and execute small functions to serverless platforms, all from your existing monolithic application.
